         <h1>Bike the Mountains Tour</h1>
      </header>
      <p>The Bike the Mountains Tour rises from the town of Littleton, 
         Colorado and explores the Colorado Front Range. Our tour 
         crosses the Continental Divide twice, giving you the 
         opportunity to bike the highest paved roads in the 
         United States. This tour is a classic showcase of Colorado's 
         Rocky Mountain scenery.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>The Bike the Mountains Tour is <em>amazing</em>. I highly 
            recommend it and would gladly return.
         </p>
         <p>&mdash; Steve H.</p>
      </blockquote> 
      <p>Not designed for the weekend cyclist, this tour is offered 
         only for those fit enough to ride high mountain passes. We 
         provide sag wagons and support. Your lodging and meals are 
         also part of the registration fee.
         We guarantee tough climbs, amazing sights, sweaty jerseys, 
         and lots of fun.
      </p>
      <p>This is the seventh year we've offered the Bike the Mountains 
         Tour. It is our most popular tour and riders are returning 
         again and again. Our experienced tour leaders will be there 
         to guide, help, encourage, draft, and lead you
         every stroke of the way. Come join us!
