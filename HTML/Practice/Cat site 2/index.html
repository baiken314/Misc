			<h2>Cats are really great</h2>
			<p>If you haven't noticed, they are the best things that there are. This site is dedicated to them and a particular group of lucky cats that get to be featured on the site.</p>
			<h2>Cats are, in fact, wonderful</h2>
			<p>Despite some people's incorrect opinions stating that cats actually are not wonderful, this fact remains true: cats are wonderful in every way and there is nothing that somebody can do to change it, so that is just how it is and has to be because it is simply such as it is.</p>

				<h1>Cat in Grass</h1>
				<img src="grassCat.jpg" width="100%"/>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>This cat is really just wonderful and it shows how at peace one can be when they embrace nature. Essentially, by what one can see by looking at this wonderful picture of a cat being in a field of grass is that one can actually and completely be on top of such a field of grass and it is only natural to, during that on-the-grass experience, feel as though one is in nature.</p>

				<h1>Lying-down Cat</h1>
				<img src="layingCat.jpg" width="100%"/>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>Here is a beautiful gray cat that is lying down ever so peacefully, once again illustrating the amount of tranquility that, as a cat, one can achieve just by following the advice of their feline companions. As you can see as well in the photo, this cat looks very much fluffy because of its fluffy fur, so that is also a good thing that one can learn from; always make sure to have good hygiene.</p>

				<h1>Cat that Looks like a Cloud</h1>
				<img src="cloudCat.jpg" width="100%"/>

			<div class="description">
				<p>This is a very special cat because it is white and very floofy so that it looks like a cloud and it could possibly be levitating or flying so that is amazing and wonderful, here is a great cat, look at it!</p>

			<div class="titleImage">
				<h1>Rion Cat</h1>
				<img src="rion.jpg" width="100%">
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>This is Rion cat, it is Rion. Say hello to Rion because he wants to be said hello to and that is a good thing to have been said to you because it is a friendly greeting of frendliness.</p>

				<h1>Dinner</h1>
				<img src="dinner.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>This is what looks to be, to our dear friend, spacebar, a thing that is called dinner, because it is a small one, however, it is not a cat, so it sure is strange that it wound up here, is it not?</p>
